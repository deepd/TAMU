HOW TO RUN?


Run main.py {python main.py}
Input the equation after the prompt “eq>”
Input the variable for which equation needs to be solved for after prompt “var>”


Disclaimers:

* Used python 2.7.5 
* Multiple instances of the variable for which equation needs to be solved is not handled (eg. : “2x + 3 = 4 + x“ this is not handled)
* Equations inside sprt/log/ln is not handled (eg: “sqrt(x+1) = 2” is not handled but “sqrt(x) = 2” is handled)
* The identities “sin^2 + cos^2” will get solved to ‘1’ only if placed next to each other (eg. : “sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2” is handled but “sin(x)^2 + y + cos(x)^2” is not handled)
* Unary Minus is not handled
* Changed color for WHITE to '' instead of '\033[97m'
* Many helper Functions are used and all helper functions have their role mentioned above the definition
* Calculus is not handled
* e^x = 1 => x = ln(1) is not handled but ln(x) = 1 => x = e^1 is handled
